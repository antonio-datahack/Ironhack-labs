Lab tasks - minimum requirement is complete tasks 1&2 before submitting the notebook via your student portal : 

1) In a jupyter notebook, using the appropriate markdown method include at least one link to a website, news article or blog which discusses ethical issues with computer vision applications and add your personal thoughts and interpretation of this issue. Here is an [example](https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/12/16882408/google-racist-gorillas-photo-recognition-algorithm-ai) if you are not sure what to look for. 

2) use the [https://vision-explorer.allenai.org/text_to_image_generation](https://vision-explorer.allenai.org/text_to_image_generation) to generate an image from a caption you provide (choosing a theme from the drop down list), which you should display inside your notebook with the caption you provided and an evaluation of how good a job you feel the machine has done-hint: you will need an image display method, for example 

```
%matplotlib inline
from IPython.display import Image
Image('your_image.png')
```

3) OPTIONAL (bonus+) read this [blog article](https://thedatafrog.com/en/articles/dogs-vs-cats/). Link the url to your notebook using the appropriate markdown technique and add a summary into your notebook (as markdown) of any image processing steps you saw the author employ. 

-Specifically, what did the coder have to do to the images in the cat v dogs dataset to enable the image classification method to be accurate 

4) OPTIONAL (double bonus++) if you have time, why not have a go with the cats v dogs [starter](https://www.kaggle.com/karakaggle/starter-kaggle-cat-vs-dog-dataset-00996c88-a) ?
